## Policy Principles

1. Developers, designers, and others using the Astro User Experience Design System should be able to easily access and understand the information they need to design and develop space apps.
2. Astro UXDS content editors should be able to easily and predictably manage content changes, adhering to the Semantic Versioning[ยน](#footnote-1) principles
3. The Astro UXDS content management process should not seem opaque, untimely, reactive, or inconsistent to designers, developers, and other primary users.
4. Due to the nature of our work, Astro UXDS content has a much longer shelf-life than typical web guidelines or frameworks. Wherever possible, we will be transparent about previous versions of Astro, which users may be working with well into the future.
